HE:     High Efficiency         802.11ax
VHT:    Very High Throughput    802.11ac
HT:     High Throughput         802.11n
legacy:                         802.11b, 802.11a/g

802.11b     (1999)  top link speed: 11M  bps
802.11a/g   (2003)                  54M  bps
802.11n     (2009)                  150M bps
802.11ac    (2013)                  866M bps single spatial stream
            with 160MHz and 256-QAM 6.97G bps 8 spatial stream
802.11ax    (2018?) improve 4x average throughput per user

AP:     Access Point
STA:    Station / Client
BSS:    Basic Service Set ==> AP + STA
DS:     Distribution System  ==> the other end of AP
ESS:    Extended Service Set (more than one AP)
        STAs can roaming within the ESS

DCF:    Distributed Coordination Function
        STA compete with each other to use channel
        Contention and backoff
PCF:    Point Coordination Function
        One work as coordinator to decide who to send packet
        AP sends poll frames to trigger transmission
DIFS:   DCF Interframe Space
SIFS:   Short Interframe Space (ex: Ack use this)
EIFS:   Extended Interface Space (the longest)
        When data corrupt, the time to wait before next transmition)
        SIFS + Ack + DIFS

MAC:    Media Access Control
SA:     Source Address
RA:     Receiver Address
TA:     Transmitter Address
DA:     Destination Address
SSID:   Service Set Identifier
BSSID:  Basic SSID (AP link layer AMC address)
ESSID:  Extended SSID (Domain name, a 32 Byte string)

HEW:    High Efficiency Wireless
OFDM:   Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
OFDMA:  Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access
CCA:    Carrier Channel Accessment
NAV:    Network Allocation Vector (includes duration)
CW:     Contention Window
WDS:    Wireless Distribution System

RTS:    Request To Send
CTS:    Clear To Send (now you can send packet)
CSMA/CA:    Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (for Wireless)
CSMA/CD:    Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection (for Wire)

RSSI:   Receive Signal Strength Indication
CSI:    Channel State Information
AC:     Access Catagory
AoA:    Angle of Arrival
NDPA:   Null Packet Announcement
NDP:    Null Packet
CCK:    Complementary Code Keying
MCS:    Modulation and Coding Index
DCM:    Dual Carrier Modulation


t-put:  throughput
thpt:   throughput

symbol: the smallest transmitted unit in PHY layer

PSK:    Phase-Shift Keying
BPSK:   Binary Phase-Shift Keying
QPSK:   Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying
QAM:    Quadrature amplitude modulation
EVM:    Error Vector Magnitude

EOSP:   End of Service Period
TBTT:   Target Beacon Transmittion Time, usually 100TU (Time Unit)

Frame Format: seq_ctrl: seq number + packet retry count
