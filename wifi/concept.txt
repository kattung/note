        STA compete with each other to use channel
        Contention and backoff

        One work as coordinator to decide who to send packet
        AP sends poll frames to trigger transmission

        The time duration for which a station can send frames
        after it has gained contention for the transmission medium.

---------------------
Broadcast:  FF:FF:FF:FF
Multicast:  xx:xx:xx:xx
            --
            b'0=1 (bit 0 of highest byte should be 1'b1)
            other bits will be the key recoganized by the targeted STAs

There's no need of ack for Broadcast and Multicast
From the view of MAC, broadcast is subset of multicast


---------------------
WMM:    Wifi Multi Media
        Define how to implement QoS of DCF in 802.11e

In overlapped BSS, STA need this information to know
if the packet is from its associated AP.
