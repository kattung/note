AID:    Association ID (index indicate the STAs associated)
TIM:    Traffic Indication Map
DTIM:   Delivery TIM (for broadcast and multicast)

EOSP:   End of Service Period
TBTT:   Target Beacon Transmittion Time, usually 100TU (Time Unit)
TXOP:   Transmission Oportunity
        When STA wake up, ask to send more than one packet within the period
        VO and VI can do this. they can reserve a exclusive transmission period
TWT:    Target Wakeup Time

APSD:   Automatic Power-Save Delivery
U-APSD: Unscheduled APSD
S-APSD: Scheduled APSD    (no one use it)

Two power saving mechanism:
1. Legacy
2. WMMPS (only use U-APSD)


Two power saving method for U-APSD:
1. Triggerd-enabled
2. Delivery-enabled
The two will be enabled at the same time automatically.
To only enable one method, use ADD-TS action frame to set up (no one use it)

For broadcast/multicast, legacy and WMMPS use the same method:
Use beacon / TIM / DTIM

TIM is in beacon frame, the bitmap in TIM indicate if there's queued data for STA.
TIM bitmap:
bit[0] = 1         : there's broadcast/multicast packet
bit[7:1] has value : there's unicast packet
                     AID can be gathered from bit[7:0] (wireshark will calculate for you)

DTIM period        : how many TIM will AP send one DTIM
DTIM count         : the count down of sending DTIM
                     when count=0, broadcast/multicast will be send in next packet
