* How to keep SSH connections alive
  DreamHost and other ISPs may kill ssh connections that remain idle longer than a certain number of minutes.

  In PuTTY (for Windows), you are able to adjust that setting in the Configuration box:
  1. Open the PuTTY general configuration.
  2. In the left Category list section, select Connection.
  3. In the field ‘Seconds between keepalives (0 to turn off)', enter 15.
  4. Check the box for ‘Enable TCP keepalives (SO_KEEPALIVE option)'.

  The SSH client asks the server for a sign of life every 15 seconds, thus keeping the connection open.

  There is some mismatch between the terminal emulator and the terminfo database
  entry being used by tmux (the one named by the TERM environment variable when
  you start/attach to a tmux server).

  Per the VT100 User Guide, Table 3-9: Special Graphics Characters, when the
  "special graphics set" is selected, x is used to draw the "Vertical bar"
  and q is used to draw "Horizontal line - Scan 5".

  Probably the effective terminfo database entry indicates that ACS is available,
  but your terminal emulator is not actually responding to the specified control sequences.

  Possible solution
  * Use putty version newer than 0.64

  * Configure putty to read UTF8
    Config / Window / Translation / Remote character set => UTF-8

  * Check below setting
    # export $TERM
    # export $TERMINFO

  * Set UTF-8 in $LANG
    # locale
    LANG=en_GB.UTF-8

    LANG should use UTF-8, type below if not
    # sudo locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
    # sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8

  * # export NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=1
