TTBR:
* For a Non-secure PL1&0 stage 1 translation, or for a Secure PL1&0 stage 1 translation,
  either TTBR0 or TTBR1 holds the required base address.
  The TTBCR is the control register for these translations.
* The Non-secure copies of TTBR0, TTBR1, and TTBCR, relate to the Non-secure PL1&0 stage 1 translation.
  The Secure copies of TTBR0, TTBR1, and TTBCR, relate to the Secure PL1&0 stage 1 translation.

For Secure or Non-secure PL1&0 translation table walks:

* TTBR0 can be configured to describe the translation of VAs in the entire address map,
  or to describe only the translation of VAs in the lower part of the address map
* If TTBR0 is configured to describe the translation of VAs in the lower part of the address map,
  TTBR1 is configured to describe the translation of VAs in the upper part of the address map.


-----------
* TTBR:
  contain the base address of page table.

* Why TTBR0 and TTBR1:
  TTBR0 for lower address translation (user space)
  TTBR1 for higher address translation (kernel space and IO mapping)
  When context switch, only TTBR0 should be changed.

* For each mode (secure / virtualization)
  There should be different page table, so different TTBR should be used.
